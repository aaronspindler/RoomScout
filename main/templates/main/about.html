            <p>RoomScout.ca was started as a little side project to help get rid of a problem that I was facing. The problem I was facing was that I was managing bills for a house that I had with a
                spreadsheet, and it became tedious to add bills and then send a spreadsheet to my tenants every month. I also had an issue of getting a new tenant when my current one had left without
                notice.</p>
            <p>I decided that I can start a project that would help solve my problems and also teach me a little about web development.</p>
            <p>If there are any bugs or issues that you face, feel free to email me personally at <a href="mailto:aaron@xnovax.net">Aaron@xNovax.net</a>, I am happy to help and hope that this project can
                grow to help others that are looking for an easier way to manage roommates.</p>
